#HRPG Lite
A HabitRPG light front-end for those that just can't stand Angular

##Purpose

To build a lean front-end for HabitRPG that's focused on performance and can be accessed from any device.

##Technology

The stack:

- SASS - for some sanity when it comes to CSS
- Gulp - for a "building" process
- React - as a view layer. May be switched out at some point
