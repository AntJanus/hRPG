#HRPG Lite
A HabitRPG light front-end for those that just can't stand Angular

##Purpose

To build a lean front-end for HabitRPG that's focused on performance and can be accessed from any device.

##Technology

The stack:

- SASS - for some sanity when it comes to CSS
- Gulp - for a "building" process
- React - as a view layer. May be switched out at some point

##hRPG specific stuff

Here are some differences between using HabitRPG and this client instead (most of these are *planned* and *NOT* implemented):

1. tasks are sorted into tag sections so that you can, at a glance, see what type of tasks are left to do.
2. collapsible sections. All tasks start out closed out on mobile to avoid rendering tons of small tasks.

##To do

- [ ] filter out tasks not relevant to "today"
- [ ] add +/- buttons for habits
- [ ] allow "check" action for all the various tasks
- [ ] epic tasks checklist
